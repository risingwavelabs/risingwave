statement ok
CREATE TABLE items (id bigint PRIMARY KEY, embedding vector(3));

statement ok
INSERT INTO items (embedding, id) VALUES ('[1,2,3]', 1), ('[4,5,6]', 2);

statement ok
FLUSH;

query
SELECT * FROM items ORDER BY l2_distance(embedding, '[3,1,2]') LIMIT 5;
----
1 [1,2,3]
2 [4,5,6]

query
SELECT * FROM items WHERE id != 1 ORDER BY l2_distance(embedding, (SELECT embedding FROM items WHERE id = 1)) LIMIT 5;
----
2 [4,5,6]

query
SELECT * FROM items WHERE l2_distance(embedding, '[3,1,2]') < 5;
----
1 [1,2,3]

statement ok
DROP TABLE items;
