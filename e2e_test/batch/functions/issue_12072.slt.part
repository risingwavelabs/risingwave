# Some exprs on `timestamptz` are implemented by a chain of 3 steps:
# * convert `timestamptz` into naive `timestamp` in the given zone
# * perform actual operation on the naive `timestamp`
# * convert naive `timestamp` in the given zone back to `timestamptz`
#
# This can lead to unintuitive results, because the first and last steps are not perfect inverse.

# Two different `timestamptz` values collapse into the same naive `timestamp`.
