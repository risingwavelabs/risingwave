# NOTE: `s` is `sum(double)` and can vary slightly across two-phase/parallel aggregation due to
# floating-point non-associativity. When cast to `numeric`, the inferred scale may differ, and
# `round(numeric, 6)` does not pad trailing zeros. Adding a `numeric` literal with scale=6 forces a
# stable scale/printout so the SLT doesn't flake on `0.050100` vs `0.0501`.
