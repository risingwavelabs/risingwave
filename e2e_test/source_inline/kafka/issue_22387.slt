# Issue Description
#
# This issue exists because:
# When we query a timestamp that is greater than all message timestamps, the Kafka SDK's `offsets_for_times` returns an offset pointing to the partition end.
# Our handling is to use the current high-watermark as the starting offset, intending to read from the latest (the first message greater than the timestamp).
# However, for normal latest offset handling, we use high-watermark - 1.
# As a result, we accessed a non-existent offset in the reader, and Kafka reset the consumer position, causing us to actually consume from the earliest offset.
