//! Local whole-SST storage with separate read, membership, and refill protocols.
//!
//! The caller registers refill candidates and unregisters obsolete objects derived from version
//! deltas. The refiller owns the ordering of these operations relative to version publication;
//! this index does not track versions.
//! A refill captures a `PinCacheRefillToken` with `prepare_refill` before it is queued;
//! the caller checks it before I/O, and `publish` checks it atomically with the index update.
//! Each object has an optional published file. The executor owns running attempts; downloads leave the
//! index unchanged until publication. Revocation changes the admission identity; unregistering
//! invalidates all object tokens.
//! Unregistering an object prevents new lookups; existing read handles retain their file.
//! Reads use `get` and never create refill work. Recovery completes before sharing the cache.
//! GC reclaims withdrawn files after their last reader releases them.
//! `storage` owns file registration and capacity; `gc` selects and deletes files using that state.
//! They share one storage lock, separate from the shard locks used by the read index.
