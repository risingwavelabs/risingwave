//! Incremental driver over the row-pattern [`Nfa`].
//!
//! The batch matcher [`Nfa::find_matches_dynamic`] rescans the whole buffer from position 0 on every
//! call. Under append-only input (rows arriving in `ORDER BY` order) most of that work is redundant:
//! `AFTER MATCH SKIP` makes the matches before a committed skip-resume point immutable, because no
//! row appended *after* them can change a match that already terminated *before* them. This wrapper
//! keeps that skip-resume point as a scan cursor and, on each [`IncrementalMatcher::advance`], reruns
//! `find_matches_dynamic` **only over the suffix that can still change** — never reimplementing the
//! NFA traversal (and so never bypassing its greedy/reluctant preference, fresh-visited-scope, or
//! `WITHIN` invariants).
//!
//! Matches are anchored by row *seq* rather than buffer *position* so they stay stable when earlier
//! rows are evicted and finalized (see [`IncrementalMatcher::finalize_evicted_prefix`]); positions are an
//! internal detail of the current buffer.
//!
//! Freezing rule (see [`IncrementalMatcher::advance`]): a match — and the scan region behind it up
//! to its skip-resume position — freezes only once *every* position in that region is dead at the
//! current boundary per [`Nfa::reaches_boundary_alive`] (the same liveness predicate row eviction
//! uses). A dead position's scan outcome can never change under appended rows, because no path from
//! it can consume past the old boundary; so the whole region's scan behavior — matches found, gaps
//! skipped, and the resume point — is final. Any live position (a still-open trailing match, or a
//! gap where a longer, higher-preference alternative is still in flight) keeps the region
//! provisional and re-attempted on the next advance.
//!
//! A late (out-of-order) row that sorts *before* rows already fed is handled by
//! `IncrementalMatcher::truncate_from_seq`: it rolls state back to a scan-resume point at or before
//! the insertion, re-verifying the freezing gate against the truncation boundary (freezing is only
//! sound against the boundary it was checked at), after which the caller re-feeds the corrected
//! sorted suffix through `advance`.
//!
//! **Scaffolding note:** under the `EVENT_TIME` plan the upstream `WatermarkSort` makes out-of-order
//! feeds unreachable, so `truncate_from_seq` and the provisional-changelog helpers
//! (`diff_provisional`, `plan_provisional_rows`, `fed_seqs`) have no production caller and are
//! compiled `#[cfg(test)]`. They are kept — proven by the randomized differential oracle in this
//! module — as the invalidation machinery a future input mode that revises already-fed rows (e.g.
//! an emit-on-update or arrival-order mode) would need, rather than shipped as live surface.
