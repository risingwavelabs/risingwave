/// Returns whether we're unsure about the fressness of the cache after the scaling from the
/// previous partition to the current one, denoted by vnode bitmaps. If the value is `true`, we must
/// evict the cache entries that does not belong to the previous partition before further
/// processing.
///
/// TODO: currently most executors simply clear all the cache entries if `true`, we can make the
/// cache aware of the consistent hashing to avoid unnecessary eviction in the future.
/// Check this [issue](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/issues/5567).
///
/// TODO: may encapsulate the logic into `ExecutorCache` when ready.
///
/// # Explanation
/// We use a lazy manner to manipulate the cache. When scaling out, the partition of the existing
/// executors will likely shrink and becomes a subset of the previous one (to ensure the best
/// locality). In this case, this function will return `false` and the cache entries that're not in
/// the current partition anymore are still kept. This achieves the best performance as we won't
/// touch and valiate the cache at all when scaling-out, which is the common case and the critical
/// path.
///
/// This brings a problem when scaling in after a while. Some partitions may be reassigned back to
/// the current executor, while the cache entries of these partitions are still unevicted. So it's
/// possible that these entries have been updated by other executors on other workers, and
/// the content is now stale! The executor must evict these entries which are not in the
/// **previous** partition before further processing.
