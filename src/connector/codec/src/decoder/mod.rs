    /// which only does type mapping, without caring about the path. And `path` itself is only an `enum` instead of `&[&str]`.
    ///
    /// What `path` to access is decided by the CDC layer, i.e., the `FORMAT ...` part (`ChangeEvent`).
    /// e.g.,
    /// - `DebeziumChangeEvent` accesses `["before", "col_name"]` for value,
    ///   `["source", "db"]`, `["source", "table"]` etc. for additional columns' values,
    ///   `["op"]` for op type.
    /// - `MaxwellChangeEvent` accesses `["data", "col_name"]` for value, `["type"]` for op type.
    /// - In the simplest case, for `FORMAT PLAIN/UPSERT` (`KvEvent`), they just access `["col_name"]` for value, and op type is derived.

    /// # Returns
    ///
    /// The implementation should prefer to return a borrowed [`DatumRef`](risingwave_common::types::DatumRef)

    /// with string or bytes data. If that's not the case, it may return an owned [`Datum`] through
