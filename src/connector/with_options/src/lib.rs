/// Annotates that the struct represents the `WITH` properties for a connector.
/// This implements a marker trait `WithOptions`.
/// It's also used to generate the `with_option_*.yaml` files.
///
/// ## Notes about how to define property structs
///
/// ### Prefer strongly-typed fields
///
/// Avoid using `HashMap` with `#[serde(flatten)]` to include all unknown fields.
/// Declare all fields explicitly instead.
///
/// The only exception now is CDC, which needs to pass a lot of options as-is to Debezium.
///
/// ### Common struct
///
/// When there are some fields can be grouped together, and/or can be shared by source and sink,
/// or by multiple connectors, define a struct for them and use the common struct as a
/// `#[serde(flatten)]` field.
///
/// Add `#[derive(WithOptions)]` to both the outer and the inner struct.
///
/// Avoid using nested `#[serde(flatten)]` field in the common struct,
/// because this will lead to unexpected serde behaviors.
/// Put all flatten fields in the top-level struct instead.
///
/// ## Field Annotations
///
/// ### Allow Alter On Fly fields (allowed in `alter table connector with`)
///
/// Use `#[with_option(allow_alter_on_fly)]` to mark fields that can be changed on the fly
/// without requiring a restart or recreation of the connector:
///
/// ```ignore
/// #[derive(WithOptions)]
/// struct MyConnectorConfig {
///     #[with_option(allow_alter_on_fly)]
///     pub rate_limit: Option<u32>,
///     pub endpoint: String,  // not allow_alter_on_fly
/// }
/// ```
