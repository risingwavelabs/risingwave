/// or proxy all requests to the latest static files built and hosted on GitHub.
///
/// - If env var `ENABLE_BUILD_DASHBOARD` is not set during the build, the requests to
///   the dashboard will be proxied. This is to reduce the build time and eliminate the
///   dependency on `node`, so that the developer experience can be better. This is the

/// - If env var `ENABLE_BUILD_DASHBOARD` is set during the build, the assets will be
///   built in the build script and embedded in the binary. This is to make the
///   deployment easier and the dashboard more reliable without relying on external or
///   remote resources. This is the default behavior for versioned releases, and can be
///   manually enabled for development builds with RiseDev.

/// If you're going to develop with the dashboard, see `dashboard/README.md` for more
/// details.
