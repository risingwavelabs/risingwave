//! Define all property of plan tree node, which actually represent property of the node's result.
//!
//! We have physical property [`Order`] and [`Distribution`] which is on batch or stream operator,
//! also, we have logical property which all [`PlanNode`][PlanNode] has.
//!
//! We have not give any common abstract trait for the property yet. They are not so much and we
//! don't need get a common behavior now. we can treat them as different traits of the
//! [`PlanNode`][PlanNode] now and refactor them when our optimizer need more
//! (such as an optimizer based on the Volcano/Cascades model).
//!
//! [PlanNode]: super::plan_node::PlanNode
