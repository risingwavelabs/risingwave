/// Context for tracing used for propagating tracing information in a distributed system.
///
/// Generally, the caller of a service should create a tracing context from the current tracing span
/// and pass it to the callee through the network. The callee will then attach its local tracing
/// span as a child of the tracing context, so that the external tracing service can associate them
/// in a single trace.
///
/// The tracing context must be serialized and deserialized when passing through the network.
/// There're two ways to do this:
///
/// - For RPC calls with clear caller/callee relationship, the tracing context can be serialized
///   into the W3C trace context format and passed in HTTP headers seamlessly with a service
///   middleware. For example, the DDL requests from the frontend to the meta service.
/// - For RPC calls with no clear caller/callee relationship or with asynchronous semantics, the
///   tracing context should be passed manually as a protobuf field in the request and response for
///   better lifetime management. For example, the exchange services between streaming actors or
///   batch stages, and the `create_task` requests from the frontend to the batch service.
///
/// See [Trace Context](https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/) for more information.
