/// The given closure `f` will take a [`CancellationToken`] as an argument. When a `SIGINT` signal
/// is received (typically by pressing `Ctrl-C`), [`CancellationToken::cancel`] will be called to
/// notify all subscribers to shutdown. You can use [`.cancelled()`](CancellationToken::cancelled)
/// to get notified on this.
///
/// Users may also send a second `SIGINT` signal to force shutdown. In this case, this function
/// will exit the process with a non-zero exit code.
///
/// When `f` returns, this function will assume that the component has finished its work and it's
/// safe to exit. Therefore, this function will exit the process with exit code 0 **without**
/// waiting for background tasks to finish. In other words, it's the responsibility of `f` to
/// ensure that all essential background tasks are finished before returning.
///
/// # Environment variables
///
/// Currently, the following environment variables will be read and used to configure the runtime.
///
/// * `RW_WORKER_THREADS` (alias of `TOKIO_WORKER_THREADS`): number of tokio worker threads. If
///   not set, it will be decided by tokio. Note that this can still be overridden by per-module
///   runtime worker thread settings in the config file.
/// * `RW_DEADLOCK_DETECTION`: whether to enable deadlock detection. If not set, will enable in
///   debug mode, and disable in release mode.
/// * `RW_PROFILE_PATH`: the path to generate flamegraph. If set, then profiling is automatically
///   enabled.
