# Next Implementation Steps for Refresh Table Fault Tolerance

Based on deep analysis of your codebase, you've built excellent foundations (~85% complete) with:
- ✅ Complete refresh workflow (Frontend → Meta → MaterializeExecutor)
- ✅ Three-phase state management (Idle → Refreshing → Finishing)
- ✅ Barrier system integration with proper serialization
- ✅ Staging table logic for merge-sort cleanup
- ✅ Well-designed RefreshProgressTable infrastructure
- ✅ Comprehensive e2e testing for basic refresh functionality

**Critical Gap Identified**: RefreshProgressTable is completely disconnected from MaterializeExecutor - it's not used for actual fault tolerance tracking.

## Phase 1: Progress Table Integration (High Priority)

### 1. Add RefreshProgressTable to RefreshableMaterializeArgs
- Initialize progress table during executor startup
- Load existing progress for recovery scenarios

### 2. Track Progress During Refresh Operations
- Update VNode progress in MaterializeExecutor when processing chunks
- Track RefreshStage transitions (Normal → Refreshing → Merging → Cleanup)
- Persist progress on barriers and periodically during processing

### 3. Implement Recovery Logic
- Skip already-completed VNodes during recovery
- Resume refresh operations from last checkpoint per VNode
- Handle partial completion scenarios gracefully

## Phase 2: Fault Tolerance Testing

### 1. Failure Injection Tests
- Test compute node crashes during different refresh stages
- Test network partitions and recovery
- Test partial VNode completion scenarios

### 2. Performance Validation
- Measure progress table overhead
- Large table refresh performance testing
- Memory usage optimization

## Phase 3: Enhanced Observability

### 1. Progress metrics and monitoring integration
### 2. User-facing progress reporting
### 3. Enhanced error messages with recovery context

The architecture is solid - the main work is connecting your excellent progress table design to the actual execution flow for true fault tolerance.
