# Buildkite CI Triage

This is a fully programmatic guide to locate the failing test case and the exact diff/mismatch directly from Buildkite build/job logs and uploaded artifacts (i.e. scriptable triage via JSON + CLI tools).

Preferred workflow: use `bk` CLI when you have access (structured JSON, easy job/artifact navigation).
Fallback: many Buildkite endpoints are publicly readable, so you can still triage via `curl` + `jq` even without local `bk` auth.

Tip: If `bk` says it needs an API token/org slug, run `bk configure` or set `BUILDKITE_API_TOKEN` and `BUILDKITE_ORGANIZATION_SLUG=risingwavelabs`.

## 0) Quick Example: e2e / SLT Triage

1) `gh pr checks` to find failing Buildkite builds.
2) Fetch `builds/<N>.json` and list failed jobs with `jq` (or use `bk build view` + `jq`).
3) For a representative failed job, fetch logs (via `bk job log` or curl) and identify:
   - which `.slt` file failed,
   - what the expected vs actual mismatch is.
4) If the top-level log only shows "command exited with status X", check artifacts:
   - list artifacts (via `bk artifacts list` or curl),
   - download `risedev-logs.zip` or `risedev-logs/nodetype-*.log`,
   - `rg` within them for the mismatch string.
5) Fix by updating the expected output file(s) under `e2e_test/**` (often a `.slt.part`).
6) Push; Buildkite will rerun on the new commit.

## 1) Find failing Buildkite checks for a PR

- **bk CLI**
  - List recent builds for a branch and pick the failing build number:
    - `export BUILDKITE_ORGANIZATION_SLUG=risingwavelabs`
    - `bk build list --pipeline <pipeline> --branch <branch> --limit 20 -o json`

- **curl (public web UI; less reliable than JSON)**
  - The easiest way is still "open the build URL from GitHub checks".
  - As a fallback, you can fetch the branch build listing HTML and manually spot build numbers:
    - `curl -sSL 'https://buildkite.com/<org>/<pipeline>/builds?branch=<urlencoded-branch>'`

- **GitHub (recommended)**
  - Use GitHub CLI to list checks:
    - `gh pr checks <PR_NUMBER> --watch=false`
  - Identify failing Buildkite checks and capture the Buildkite build URL(s), e.g.:
    - `https://buildkite.com/<org>/<pipeline>/builds/<build_number>`

## 2) Get Build Info As JSON

- **Commands**
  - `bk:` `bk build view <build_number> --pipeline <pipeline> -o json > .context/bk_<build_number>.json`
  - `curl:` `curl -sSL https://buildkite.com/<org>/<pipeline>/builds/<build_number>.json > .context/bk_<build_number>.json`

Notes:
- The `builds/<N>.json` response is a single JSON object (not wrapped in `{ "build": ... }`).
- Some fields like `raw_log_url` may be null; prefer using job `id` + the endpoints below.

## 3) List Failed Jobs In A Build

- Parse the JSON from step (2):
  - `jq -r '.jobs[] | select(.exit_status!=null and .exit_status!=0) | [(.name // .step.label), (.exit_status|tostring), .id] | @tsv' .context/bk_<build_number>.json`

## 4) Fetch A Job Log

- **Commands**
  - `bk:` `bk job log <job_id> -p <pipeline> -b <build_number> --no-timestamps`
  - `curl:` `curl -sSL 'https://buildkite.com/organizations/<org>/pipelines/<pipeline>/builds/<build_number>/jobs/<job_id>/log' > .context/job_<job_id>_log.json`
- **Notes**
  - `bk` output: if it contains ANSI escapes, strip them with:
    - `... | tr -cd '\11\12\15\40-\176' | perl -pe 's/\[[0-9;]*[mK]//g; s/\r//g'`
  - `curl` output: convert JSON to plain text by `html.unescape(output)`, regex-strip `<...>` tags, then `splitlines()`.

Common patterns to search:
- `query result mismatch`
- `[Diff] (-expected|+actual)`
- `query is expected to fail with error:`

## 5) Inspect Artifacts

Many CI scripts upload extra logs as artifacts (e.g. `risedev-logs.zip`, `risedev-logs/nodetype-*.log`) which contain the real failure details. The `risedev-logs.zip` artifact contains all logs.

- **Commands**
  - List artifacts:
    - `bk:` `bk artifacts list <build_number> -p <pipeline> --job <job_id> -o json`
    - `curl:` `curl -sSL 'https://buildkite.com/organizations/<org>/pipelines/<pipeline>/builds/<build_number>/jobs/<job_id>/artifacts'`
  - Download an artifact by UUID:
    - `bk:` `bk artifacts download <artifact_id>`
    - `curl:` `curl -sSL 'https://buildkite.com/organizations/<org>/pipelines/<pipeline>/builds/<build_number>/jobs/<job_id>/artifacts/<artifact_id>' -o /tmp/artifact`

Notes:
- Some `.../download` URLs may 404 for anonymous access. The non-`/download` artifact endpoint often works and redirects internally.
- The artifact endpoint typically responds with a 302 to `buildkiteartifacts.com` (signed URL). `curl -L` follows it.

## 6) Practical Tips / Pitfalls

- Buildkite pages are huge; prefer `.json` endpoints and `jq` over scraping HTML.
- `curl | head` can error with "Failure writing output" due to stdout buffering; redirect to a file.
- `bk` CLI: some commands still require `BUILDKITE_ORGANIZATION_SLUG=risingwavelabs` even if `-p` is provided.
- Exit codes:
  - `105`: commonly seen when the Buildkite `docker-compose` plugin reports a non-zero step (e2e/SLT jobs). Inspect the SLT output / artifacts for the real failure.
  - `4`: commonly seen in deterministic simulation / recovery steps when the simulation runner script exits non-zero. Details are usually in uploaded logs.
  - `143`: usually means termination/cancellation (SIGTERM), not necessarily a product regression.
