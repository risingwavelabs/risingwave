# Build, Run, Test

You may need to learn how to build and test RisingWave when implementing features or fixing bugs.

- Use `./risedev b` to build the project.
- Use `./risedev c` to check if the code follow rust-clippy rules, coding styles, etc.
- Use `./risedev d` to run a RisingWave instance. If the project is not built, this will build the project before running. The instance will run in backgroud, so you don't need to start a new terminal to run this command. You can connect to the instance right after this command is finished.
- Use `./risedev k` to stop a RisingWave instance started by `./risedev d`.
- The log files of a running RisingWave are located in `.risingwave/log` folder in the workspace. You can check them (`tail` is suggested because they can be quite long) if things go wrong.
- When a RisingWave instance is running, you can use `./risedev psql -c "<your query>"` to run SQL queries in RW.
- When a RisingWave instance is running, you can use `./risedev slt './path/to/e2e-test-file.slt'` to run end-to-end SLT tests. File globs like `/**/*.slt` is allowed.
- Integration tests and unit tests are valid Rust/Tokio tests, you can locate and run those related in a standard Rust way.
- `./risedev` command is safe to run automatically.
