# Build, Run, Test

You may need to learn how to build and test RisingWave when implementing features or fixing bugs.

## Build & Check

- Use `./risedev b` to build the project.
- Use `./risedev c` to check if the code follow rust-clippy rules, coding styles, etc.

## Unit Test

- Integration tests and unit tests are valid Rust/Tokio tests, you can locate and run those related in a standard Rust way.
- Parser tests: use `./risedev update-parser-test` to regenerate expected output.
- Planner tests: use `./risedev run-planner-test [name]` to run and `./risedev do-apply-planner-test` (or `./risedev dapt`) to update expected output.

## End-to-End Test

- Use `./risedev d` to run a RisingWave instance in the background via tmux.
  * It builds first if needed, and kills the previous instance if exists.
  * Optionally pass a profile name (see `risedev.yml`) to choose external services or components. By default it uses `default`.
  * This runs in the background so you do not need a separate terminal.
  * You can connect right after the command finishes.
  * Logs are written to files in `.risingwave/log` folder.
- Use `./risedev k` to stop a RisingWave instance started by `./risedev d`.
- When a RisingWave instance is running, you can use `./risedev psql -c "<your query>"` to run SQL queries in RW.
- When a RisingWave instance is running, you can use `./risedev slt './path/to/e2e-test-file.slt'` to run end-to-end SLT tests.
  * File globs like `/**/*.slt` is allowed.
  * Failed run may leave some objects in the database that interfere with next run. Use `./risedev slt-clean ./path/to/e2e-test-file.slt` to reset the database before running tests.
- The preferred way to write tests is to write tests in SQLLogicTest format.
- Tests are put in `./e2e_test` folder.

## Misc

- `./risedev` command is safe to run automatically.
- Never run `git` mutation command (`git add`, `git rebase`, `git commit`, `git push`, etc) unless user explicitly asks for it.

## Sandbox escalation

When sandboxing is enabled, these commands need `require_escalated` because they bind or connect to local TCP sockets:

- `./risedev d` and `./risedev p` (uses local ports and tmux sockets)
- `./risedev psql ...` or direct `psql -h localhost -p 4566 ...` (local TCP connection)
- `./risedev slt './path/to/e2e-test-file.slt'` (connects to local TCP via psql protocol)
- Any command that checks running services via local TCP (for example, health checks or custom SQL clients)
