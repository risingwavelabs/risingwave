# `cargo-nextest` will spawn a process for each test. Avoid including `%p` in the file name pattern
# to avoid creating too many profraw files. Instead, use `%m` to reuse the profraw files for the
# same test binary. Here `%4m` means that there's a pool of 4 profraw files for each test binary.
# This achieves a good balance between the performance of running tests and generating reports.
