RisingWave is a stream processing and management platform designed to offer the <i><b>simplest</b></i> and <i><b>most cost-effective</b></i> way to <b>process</b>, <b>analyze</b>, and <b>manage</b> real-time event data â€” with built-in support for the [Apache Icebergâ„¢](https://iceberg.apache.org/) open table format. It provides both a Postgres-compatible [SQL interface](https://docs.risingwave.com/sql/overview) and a DataFrame-style [Python interface](https://docs.risingwave.com/python-sdk/intro).

RisingWave can <b>ingest</b> millions of events per second, continuously <b>join and analyze</b> live streams with historical data, <b>serve</b> ad-hoc queries at low latency, and <b>persist</b> fresh, consistent results to Apache Icebergâ„¢ or any other downstream system.

## Try it out in 60 seconds

Install RisingWave standalone mode:
```shell
curl -L https://risingwave.com/sh | sh
```

To learn about other installation options, such as using a Docker image, see [Quick Start](https://docs.risingwave.com/docs/current/get-started/).

## Stream, Store, and Query â€” All in One

RisingWave delivers a full **end-to-end streaming data platform** â€” combining real-time processing with built-in storage and open-format persistence.

It supports:

* **Ingestion:** Ingest millions of events per second from streaming and batch sources.
* **Stream processing:** Perform real-time incremental processing to join and analyze live data with historical tables.
* **Delivery:** Deliver fresh, consistent results to data lakes (e.g., Apache Icebergâ„¢) or any destination.

What sets RisingWave apart is its integrated storage engine:

* **Online serving:** Row-based storage optimized for point and range queries with single-digit millisecond latency.
* **Offline persistence:** Built-in Apache Icebergâ„¢ integration for low-cost, durable storage with open access for external query engines.

With RisingWave, real-time data isnâ€™t just processed â€” itâ€™s stored, queried, and shared across your entire stack.

## Key design decisions

RisingWave is designed to be easier to use and more cost-efficient:

### PostgreSQL compatibility

* **Seamless integration:** Connects via the PostgreSQL wire protocol, working with psql, JDBC, and any Postgres tool.
* **Expressive SQL:** Supports structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data with a familiar SQL dialect.
* **No manual state tuning:** Eliminates complex state management configurations.

### S3 as primary storage

RisingWave stores tables, materialized views, and internal states of stream processing jobs in S3 (or equivalent object storage), providing:
- **High performance:** Optimized for complex queries, including joins and time windowing.
- **Fast recovery:** Restores from system failures within seconds.
- **[Dynamic scaling](https://docs.risingwave.com/deploy/k8s-cluster-scaling):** Instantly adjusts resources to handle workload spikes.

### Elastic disk cache

Beyond caching hot data in memory, RisingWave supports [**elastic disk cache**](https://docs.risingwave.com/get-started/disk-cache), a powerful performance optimization that uses local disks or EBS for efficient data caching. This minimizes access to S3, lowering processing latency and cutting S3 access costs.

### Apache Icebergâ„¢ native support
RisingWave [**natively integrates with Apache Icebergâ„¢**](https://docs.risingwave.com/iceberg/overview), enabling continuous ingestion of streaming data into Iceberg tables. It can also read directly from Iceberg, perform automatic compaction, and maintain table health over time. Since Iceberg is an open table format, results are accessible by other query engines â€” making storage not only cost-efficient, but interoperable by design.

## In what use cases does RisingWave excel?
RisingWave is particularly effective for the following use cases:

* **Streaming analytics**: Achieve sub-second data freshness in live dashboards, ideal for high-stakes scenarios like stock trading, sports betting, and IoT monitoring.
* **Event-driven applications**: Develop sophisticated monitoring and alerting systems for critical applications such as fraud and anomaly detection.
* **Real-time data enrichment**: Continuously ingest data from diverse sources, conduct real-time data enrichment, and efficiently deliver the results to downstream systems.
* **Feature engineering**: Transform batch and streaming data into features in your machine learning models using a unified codebase, ensuring seamless integration and consistency.

## Production deployments
