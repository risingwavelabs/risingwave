RisingWave is the world's most advanced event stream processing platform engineered to provide the <i><b>simplest</b></i> and <i><b>most cost-efficient</b></i> approach for <b>processing</b>, <b>analyzing</b>, and <b>managing</b> real-time event streaming data. It provides both a Postgres-compatible [SQL interface](https://docs.risingwave.com/sql/overview) and a DataFrame-style [Python interface](https://docs.risingwave.com/python-sdk/intro).

RisingWave can <b>ingest</b> millions of events per second, continuously <b>join and analyze</b> live data streams with historical tables, <b>serve</b> ad-hoc queries at low latency, and <b>deliver</b> fresh, consistent results wherever needed.

## Try it out in 60 seconds

Install RisingWave standalone mode:
```shell
curl -L https://risingwave.com/sh | sh
```

To learn about other installation options, such as using a Docker image, see [Quick Start](https://docs.risingwave.com/docs/current/get-started/).

## Not just a stream processor!

RisingWave simplifies **end-to-end** development of real-time data pipelines and applications - going beyond traditional stream processors.

Like other stream processors, RisingWave supports:

* **Ingestion:** Ingest millions of events per second from streaming and batch sources.
* **Stream processing:** Perform real-time incremental processing to join and analyze live data with historical tables.
* **Delivery:** Deliver fresh, consistent results to data lakes (e.g., Apache Iceberg) or any destination.

But RisingWave does more. It provides both **online and offline storage**:

* **Online serving:** Row-based storage for ad-hoc point/range queries with single-digit millisecond latency.
* **Offline persistence:** Apache Iceberg-based storage that persists streaming data at low cost, enabling open access by other query engines.

## Key design decisions

RisingWave is designed to be easier to use and more cost-efficient:

### PostgreSQL compatibility

* **Seamless integration:** Connects via the PostgreSQL wire protocol, working with psql, JDBC, and any Postgres tool.
* **Expressive SQL:** Supports structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data with a familiar SQL dialect.
* **No manual state tuning:** Eliminates complex state management configurations.

### S3 as primary storage

RisingWave stores tables, materialized views, and internal states of stream processing jobs in S3 (or equivalent object storage), providing:
- **High performance:** Optimized for complex queries, including joins and time windowing.
- **Fast recovery:** Restores from system failures within seconds.
- **[Dynamic scaling](https://docs.risingwave.com/deploy/k8s-cluster-scaling):** Instantly adjusts resources to handle workload spikes.

### Elastic disk cache

Beyond caching hot data in memory, RisingWave supports [**elastic disk cache**](https://docs.risingwave.com/get-started/disk-cache), a powerful performance optimization that uses local disks or EBS for efficient data caching. This minimizes access to S3, lowering processing latency and cutting S3 access costs.

## In what use cases does RisingWave excel?
RisingWave is particularly effective for the following use cases:

* **Streaming analytics**: Achieve sub-second data freshness in live dashboards, ideal for high-stakes scenarios like stock trading, sports betting, and IoT monitoring.
* **Event-driven applications**: Develop sophisticated monitoring and alerting systems for critical applications such as fraud and anomaly detection.
* **Real-time data enrichment**: Continuously ingest data from diverse sources, conduct real-time data enrichment, and efficiently deliver the results to downstream systems.
* **Feature engineering**: Transform batch and streaming data into features in your machine learning models using a unified codebase, ensuring seamless integration and consistency.

## Production deployments

[**RisingWave Cloud**](https://cloud.risingwave.com) offers the easiest way to run RisingWave in production.

For **Docker deployment**, please refer to [Docker Compose](https://docs.risingwave.com/docs/current/risingwave-docker-compose/).

For **Kubernetes deployment**, please refer to [Kubernetes with Helm](https://docs.risingwave.com/docs/current/risingwave-k8s-helm/) or [Kubernetes with Operator](https://docs.risingwave.com/docs/current/risingwave-kubernetes/).
