RisingWave is the world's most advanced event stream processing platform engineered to provide the <i><b>simplest</b></i> and <i><b>most cost-efficient</b></i> approach for <b>processing</b>, <b>analyzing</b>, and <b>managing</b> real-time event streaming data. It provides both a Postgres-compatible [SQL interface](https://docs.risingwave.com/sql/overview) and a DataFrame-style [Python interface](https://docs.risingwave.com/python-sdk/intro).

RisingWave can <b>ingest</b> millions of events per second, continuously <b>join and analyze</b> live data streams with historical tables, <b>serve</b> ad-hoc queries at low latency, and <b>deliver</b> fresh, consistent results wherever needed.

## Try it out in 60 seconds

Install RisingWave standalone mode:
```shell
curl -L https://risingwave.com/sh | sh
```

To learn about other installation options, such as using a Docker image, see [Quick Start](https://docs.risingwave.com/docs/current/get-started/).

## What is RisingWave optimized for?
RisingWave simplifies the development of real-time data pipelines and applications. It is purpose-built to:

* **Ingestion**: Ingest millions of events per second from both streaming and batch data sources.
* **Stream processing**: Perform real-time incremental data processing to join and analyze live data streams with historical tables.
* **Serving**: Persist data and serve ad-hoc queries with single-digit millisecond latency.
* **Delivery**: Deliver fresh, consistent results to data lakes (e.g., Apache Iceberg) or any destination.


## Why is RisingWave special?
RisingWave stands apart from traditional stream processing systems due to its:

### PostgreSQL compatibility
Connect via the PostgreSQL wire protocol - using psql, JDBC, or any Postgres tool.
* **Seamless integration**: Works with a wide range of tools in the PostgreSQL ecosystem.
* **Expressive SQL**: Supports structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data using a rich, familiar SQL dialect.
* **No manual state tuning**: Eliminates the need for complex state management configurations.

### Zero disk architecture
All data lives in S3 (or equivalent), with local disk used only as a cache.
* **Optimized for complex queries**: Ensures high performance for stateful operations like joins and time windowing.
* **Fast failure recovery**: Recovers from system crashes within seconds.
* **Dynamic scaling**: Adjusts resources instantly to handle workload spikes.



## In what use cases does RisingWave excel?
RisingWave is particularly effective for the following use cases:

* **Streaming analytics**: Achieve sub-second data freshness in live dashboards, ideal for high-stakes scenarios like stock trading, sports betting, and IoT monitoring.
* **Event-driven applications**: Develop sophisticated monitoring and alerting systems for critical applications such as fraud and anomaly detection.
* **Real-time data enrichment**: Continuously ingest data from diverse sources, conduct real-time data enrichment, and efficiently deliver the results to downstream systems.
* **Feature engineering**: Transform batch and streaming data into features in your machine learning models using a unified codebase, ensuring seamless integration and consistency.
